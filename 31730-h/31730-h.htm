<h1>Subspeciation in the Meadow Mouse,
Microtus montanus, in Wyoming
and Colorado</h1>

<h3>BY</h3>

<h2>SYDNEY ANDERSON</h2>


<p><i>Microtus montanus</i> reaches the eastern limits of its geographic
distribution in Wyoming and Colorado. There the mountains, but
in general not the lowlands, are occupied by this species. A certain
minimum of moisture may be of direct importance to the mouse and
certainly is indirectly important, because certain hydrophytic or
mesophytic grasses used by the mouse for food, for protection from
enemies, and for shelter from the elements are dependent on the
moisture. Areas suitable for <i>Microtus montanus</i> are separated by
deserts that are dominated by sagebrush and other xerophytic plants
or by forests or rocky exposures at higher altitudes. A relatively
small percentage, probably less than ten per cent, of the total area
even in the more favorable parts of the range of the species is suitable
for occupancy. In these mice, as in other microtines (Elton,
1942; Piper, 1909), there are seasonal, and irregularly multiannual
fluctuations in population density, which sometimes are extreme.
Consequently the mice at some times seem to be absent from suitable
habitats, and at some other times occur there in amazingly
large numbers.</p>

<p>Because the species is broken up into partly isolated, or at times
completely isolated, colonies or local populations it may be supposed
that various evolutionary forces such as selection and random genetic
drift operate to foster variation. The degree to which racial distinction
is attained may depend upon these forces and the time available.
In <i>Microtus montanus</i> in the eastern Rocky Mountains the
degree of subspecific distinction is not great.</p>

<p>The study here reported upon is based on 1,187 specimens of
<i>Microtus montanus</i> from Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho and Montana,
and on work in the field. I spent approximately four months in the
field in this area, in the summers of 1950, 1951, and 1952. The specimens
studied were arranged according to localities and the larger
series were compared statistically. Each of two series, totaling 136
specimens, was studied intensively to ascertain the kind and range
of variation within single populations. Twenty-seven measurements,
various proportions based on these measurements, and differences
in color were analyzed. Fifteen characters, judged to be most significant,
were selected for use in comparing all series. In addition,
certain characters that can not be expressed easily by measurements,
such as inflation of the auditory bullae and the curvature of the
zygomatic arch, were observed. The studies by A. B. Howell
(1924) of variation in <i>Microtus montanus yosemite</i> Grinnell in California
and those by O. B. Goin (1943) of <i>Microtus pennsylvanicus
pennsylvanicus</i> (Ord) were useful. The external measurements
are from the collectors' field labels. The measurements of the skull
all were taken with dial calipers reading to a tenth of a millimeter.
The anteroposterior measurements of the skull all were taken along
the shortest line between the points specified below and are not
necessarily along a line parallel to the long axis of the skull. These
measurements were taken on the left side of the skull whenever
possible. Some of the skulls are damaged and therefore some
measurements could not be taken and are omitted in the computations.
Measurements are in millimeters.</p>

<p>The results of these studies were submitted to the Department of
Zoology and the Graduate School of the University of Kansas in
partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of
Arts (1952) and are available in manuscript form at the Museum of
Natural History and the library of the University of Kansas.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Explanation of Measurements</span></h3>

<blockquote><p>Caudal index.&mdash;the length of the tail expressed as a percentage of the length
of the head and body. The length of the head and body is the collector's
measurement of total length less the length of the tail.</p></blockquote>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cranial Measurements of Length.</span></h4>

<blockquote><p>Condylobasilar length.&mdash;from the exoccipital condyle to the most posterior
point on the border of the alveolus of the upper incisor.</p>

<p>Alveolobasilar length.&mdash;from the posterior border of the alveolus of the third
upper molar to the posterior border of the alveolus of the incisor.</p>

<p>Palatilar length.&mdash;from the anteriormost part of the posterior border of the
bony shelf of the palate to the posteriormost part of the alveolus of the
incisor.</p>

<p>Alveolar length of upper molar tooth-row.&mdash;from the most posterior point of
the alveolus of the third upper molar to the most anterior point of the
alveolus of the first upper molar.</p></blockquote>

<h4><span class="smcap">Measurements of Breadth.</span></h4>

<blockquote><p>Zygomatic breadth.&mdash;greatest transverse width.</p>

<p>Interorbital breadth.&mdash;the breadth of the interorbital constriction.</p>

<p>Lambdoidal breadth.&mdash;between the lateralmost points of the lambdoidal crest.</p>

<p>Prelambdoidal breadth.&mdash;between the medialmost margins of the prominent
fenestrae in the posterodorsal parts of the squamosal bones. To these
fenestrae Howell (1924:995) applied the adjective "prelambdoidal," but other
authors have used other names (see Hill, 1935:127).</p>

<p>Depth of braincase.&mdash;shortest distance from the ventral side of the cranium at
the suture between the basioccipital and basisphenoid bones to the dorsal
surface of the cranium (usually not perpendicular to the long axis of the
skull).</p></blockquote>

<p>The history of our knowledge of <i>Microtus montanus</i> in this area
begins with the early work of the United States Bureau of Biological
Survey directed by C. H. Merriam (1891), and participated in by
Vernon Bailey (1900, 1917), Merritt Cary (1911, 1917), and others.
The changes in nomenclature which grew out of increased understanding
of these mice through additional collecting are expressed
in the synonymies under the accounts of subspecies. As a result
of my studies two of the three subspecific names previously proposed
for mice from this area have been retained although changes are
proposed in the ranges assigned to the two subspecies and two additional
heretofore unrecognized subspecies are named and described.
Furthermore the additional specimens and my studies of
variation make modifications in the characterization of these subspecies
necessary. Not all of the samples here assigned to a single
subspecies are identical and I therefore list and discuss some of the
local variants.</p>

<blockquote><p>Numerous members of summer field parties from the Museum of Natural
History at the University of Kansas collected most of the specimens studied
and wrote field notes that have been helpful. I am grateful to these persons
and to Professor E. R. Hall and Dr. R. H. Baker for their assistance and helpful
suggestions. Specimens in the following museums were made available by
their respective curators: Chicago Natural History Museum by Mr. Colin C.
Sandborn, The Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan by Dr. E. T.
Hooper, The American Museum of Natural History by Mr. G. G. Goodwin,
The United States National Museum by Dr. David H. Johnson and the Biological
Surveys Collection by Miss Viola S. Schantz. A fellowship from the
National Science Foundation made possible the studies at the museums other
than at the University of Kansas.</p></blockquote>

differs as follows: averages smaller; slightly darker and less reddish and less
yellowish in color; slightly wider braincase (see measurement of prelambdoidal
breadth); larger bullae.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;Average (= arithmetical mean) measurements of 34 specimens,
both male and female, from several localities in eastern Idaho are: total
length, 151; length of tail, 39; hind foot, 19.2; condylobasilar length of the
skull, 25.0; zygomatic breadth, 15.0; alveolar length of upper molar tooth-row,
6.4; prelambdoidal breadth, 8.9; and lambdoidal breadth, 11.7.</p>

<p>Average and extreme measurements of six adult males from near Pocatello,
Bannock County, Idaho, and nine adult males from near Afton, Lincoln County,
Wyoming, are, respectively, as follows: total length, 143(135-150), 163(143-179);

alveolar length of upper molar tooth-row, 6.3(6.1-6.5), 6.3(6.0-6.6); depth
of braincase, 7.7(7.5-7.9), 8.0(7.7-8.3); lambdoidal breadth, 11.4(11.0-11.7),
12.0(11.3-12.7); prelambdoidal breadth, 9.1(8.6-9.4), 8.7(8.0-9.4); zygomatic
breadth, 14.3(13.8-14.7), 15.3(14.4-16.3); interorbital breadth, 3.6(3.5-3.7),
3.5(3.3-3.7). The average length of the nasal bones in the series from Pocatello
is 7.1 mm. The averages, which have not been included in <a href="#table_1">Table 1</a>, for
three measurements of the series from Carbon County, Wyoming, are as follows
(Encampment, males; Encampment, females; Savery, males; and Savery, females,
respectively): alveolobasilar length, 14.4, 14.3, 14.5, 14.3; interorbital
breadth, 3.5, 3.4, 3.5, 3.4; depth of braincase, 7.8, 7.6, 7.9, 7.6. Additional
measurements are included in<a href="#table_1"> Table 1</a> for other series.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Discussion.</i>&mdash;The name <i>Microtus montanus caryi</i> Bailey is here
placed in synonymy under <i>M. m. nanus</i> (Merriam). Vernon Bailey
(1917) in his description of <i>caryi</i> made four assumptions that have
been found to be entirely or partly invalid. First, he assumed that
this is an "extreme variant which gradually changes in characters
across Nevada and Utah, and reaches its maximum variation in
Wyoming." The differences pointed out in subsequent descriptions
of subspecies found in the above area do not show a gradual change
in any character, or in the number of characters, nor is <i>caryi</i> an
extreme when compared with the other subspecies. Second,
<i>Microtus nanus</i> was not, as Bailey assumed, a different species than
<i>Microtus montanus</i>. Third, he assumed that the characteristics of
adults of <i>nanus</i> were adequately ascertainable from the thirteen
topotypes available to him. Subsequent sampling from Idaho shows
that the series of specimens available to Bailey was made up mostly
of young and subadult animals. Finally, <i>caryi</i> does not occupy as
Bailey stated "the meadows along streams in the arid sagebrush
country of the Bear River, Green River, and Wind River valleys"
exclusively, or characteristically. When the localities from which
the species actually is known are plotted, it seems that the arid
basin serves as a barrier and that the species is more commonly and
abundantly found in montane meadows in the Transition and
Canadian life-zones.</p>

<p>Certain samples, here assigned to <i>M. m. nanus</i>, that vary from the
average of the subspecies deserve comment. For example, mice
from the area in Wyoming southwest of the Green River (in the
Uinta Mountains) have relatively smaller feet, but are larger in both
total length and size of skull. Specimens from near Afton, Lincoln
County, Wyoming, are relatively large in both total length and size
of skull. This series and specimens from Teton County, Wyoming,
are intermediate between <i>nanus</i> from Idaho and the newly named
subspecies from near Cody, Park County, Wyoming, described
below, in terms of both darkness and the amount of reddish color.
Mice from Laramie County are more richly reddish-brown. The
specimens from near Savery, in Carbon County, Wyoming, are
darker. The alveolobasilar length relative to the condylobasilar
length is smaller in the series from along Deer Creek, 16 mi. S, 11
mi. W Waltman, Natrona County, Wyoming. The series from the
southern tier of counties in Wyoming and some of the specimens
from Colorado have relatively wider zygomatic arches. The specimens
from southern Sweetwater County, Wyoming, are relatively
paler, have a relatively longer tail and longer hindfeet, lesser
condylobasilar length, and wider braincase. Most of these variations
are of questionable significance; they may be chance variations
owing to errors in sampling.</p>

<p>Much of the south-central part of the state is relatively low and
relatively arid. This area includes the arid basin of the Green
River and its major tributaries and the arid Red Desert along the
continental divide in Sweetwater County. This area might have
acted as a barrier to the mice; gene flow might have been prevented
between the populations of the western part of the state and those
farther east in the Medicine Bow Mountains and Laramie Mountains.
Nevertheless geographic variations of subspecific worth have
not taken place. The barrier has either not been of as long duration,
or has not been so complete and effective, as the other barriers
in the state, namely the Absaroka Range, the Big Horn Basin, the
Shoshone Basin, and the valley of the North Platte River. These
four barriers presumably have led to the differentiation of the two
subspecies that are newly named beyond. Each of the two areas
which is set apart by these barriers and in which one of the newly
named subspecies has evolved is small; therefore there is a lesser
amount of suitable habitat available for each of the newly named
mice than there is for <i>M. m. nanus</i>. It is conceivable, therefore,
that in periods of adverse conditions in each of the small areas the
size of the effective breeding population may have been so small
that random genetic drift could have operated effectively, or that
selection was more critical than in a larger, more stable population.
It is difficult to test these possibilities because the selective value of
the taxonomic characters is unknown. The observed pattern of
variation and facts of distribution are, however, not contradictory
to the above possibilities.</p>

the size is larger (see diagnosis and measurements). Certain proportions
which differ from those of <i>nanus</i> and which are not in close agreement with

as well as actually longer tail; the hind foot averages longer; the upper molar
tooth-row is relatively longer; the color is slightly paler and less grizzled; the
bullae are larger and less flattened; the angle formed at the suture between
the basioccipital and basisphenoid bones is less acute; and the region of the
suture is less prominently elevated between the bullae when viewed from the
ventral aspect. The pterygoid plates mesial and posterodorsal to the posterior

<p><i>Discussion.</i>&mdash;Three species of <i>Microtus</i> were collected by James
W. Bee at the type locality. <i>Microtus montanus codiensis</i>, <i>Microtus
longicaudus mordax</i>, and <i>Microtus pennsylvanicus modestus</i> were
taken in the same runways in the same meadow, at the same time.
<i>Microtus ochrogaster haydeni</i>, although not taken at this locality,
occurs in the Big Horn Basin. These four species differ in their
geographic ranges, being largely allopatric, except <i>M. montanus</i> and
<i>M. longicaudus</i> which are sympatric. Although the different species
have ecological preferences and habits which differ, several species
of <i>Microtus</i> may occur together in local areas such as the above.
Certain of the characteristics of <i>M. m. codiensis</i> are intermediate
between those of the species <i>M. montanus</i> on one hand and those
of the other three species on the other hand. Could interspecific
hybridization between "good species" of <i>Microtus</i> take place in
nature and possibly alter the characteristics of a local population?</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;The Big Horn Mountains of north-central Wyoming.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;A large <i>Microtus montanus</i> with a relatively short tail; short
molar series; broad zygomatic arches well rounded in lateral outline when
viewed from above; small and flattened bullae; raised basioccipito-basisphenoid
suture.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;For comparison with <i>M. m. codiensis</i> from the west, on the
other side of the Big Horn Basin, see the account of that subspecies. In comparison
with <i>nanus</i> this subspecies is slightly paler, in this respect showing
more resemblance to <i>codiensis</i> although not so pale, and more grizzled or
unevenly colored. This difference in color between <i>zygomaticus</i> and <i>codiensis</i>
may not be of taxonomic significance. From both the topotypes of <i>nanus</i>, and
the series of it from Wyoming, <i>zygomaticus</i> differs on the average in having a
relatively shorter tail, a relatively shorter upper molar tooth-row, relatively
more rounded and relatively more wide-spread zygomatic arches, and smaller
more flattened bullae.</p>

<p><i>Discussion.</i>&mdash;This subspecies is separated from <i>M. m. codiensis</i> to
the west by the Big Horn Basin. A series from along Buffalo Creek,
27 mi. N, 1 mi. E Powder River, 6075 ft., in Natrona County, Wyoming,
is intermediate between the topotypes of <i>zygomaticus</i> and
<i>nanus</i> in the characters cited above as distinguishing the two, but
shows greater resemblance to <i>zygomaticus</i> in the shape of the
zygomatic arch, in color which is paler than in topotypes of
<i>zygomaticus</i>, and in the short hind foot. On these and on geographic
grounds this population is referred to <i>zygomaticus</i>. Unfortunately
we cannot be certain in many cases that an intermediate condition
in a certain character indicates a genetically intermediate population
and therefore true intergradation between the two subspecies
to which the population is geographically intermediate. The topotypes
of this subspecies are the most distinct of all the series which
I have studied from the eastern Rocky Mountains, in terms of the
degree of morphological departure from the norm for the species.
After <i>zygomaticus</i> the following populations are arranged according
to their degree of deviation from this norm (<i>codiensis</i> deviates
most): topotypes of <i>codiensis</i>, <i>fusus</i> and a population from southern
Sweetwater County, Wyoming, and lastly the <i>nanus-caryi</i> complex.
Within the latter group, as I have mentioned, there are a number
of local variants most of which do not differ significantly and do
not conform to any geographic pattern.</p>

<p><i>Discussion.</i>&mdash;There is no sharp boundary between <i>M. m. fusus</i> of
southern Colorado and the subspecies to the north, <i>M. m. nanus</i>.
Although the line separating these two subspecies is drawn somewhat
arbitrarily, on the whole the samples from north of this line
more closely resemble <i>nanus</i>. All of the means for total length
given above are larger than the maximum given in Hall's description
of <i>fusus</i>. The caudal index (38 and 35% in two series) is
slightly larger than that cited by Hall (33.3%) and is not significantly
different from that in <i>nanus</i> (35.2%). The color in both young and
old mice is variable, but in general is more yellowish, and less
grayish, than in any other series studied.</p>

<p>There is a large area in western Colorado and eastern Utah,
between the known ranges of <i>M. m. fusus</i> and <i>M. m. amosus</i> from
which there are no specimens. Probably the species occurs only at
certain places in this arid region which seems to be a partial barrier
to the species.</p>

<p>Specimens of <i>M. montanus</i> from northern New Mexico have been
referred previously to <i>M. m. arizonensis</i>. When he named <i>M. m.
fusus</i>, Hall mentioned its resemblance to <i>arizonensis</i> in reddish
coloration, but pointed out that <i>fusus</i> is less reddish. Of six specimens
from Valle Santa Rosa, Jemez Mountains (USBS), 8500 ft.,
Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, three are immature, and the skulls
of the remaining specimens are damaged. In reddish color and
relatively large size these few specimens resemble <i>arizonensis</i> more
than <i>fusus</i> although the locality of occurrence is closer to the geographic
range of the northern <i>fusus</i> than to that of <i>arizonensis</i>. The
identification of these specimens as <i>arizonensis</i> is provisional; additional
specimens are needed from the area, 200 miles wide, which
separates the ranges as now known of <i>arizonensis</i> in Arizona from
the occurrence in New Mexico. There is a single specimen from
this area, the damaged skull of which prevents conclusive identification.
The specimen is either <i>M. montanus</i> or <i>M. mexicanus</i>, and
is from Nutria, on the southern edge of the Zuni Mountains (USBS).
Detailed comparison of <i>fusus</i> and <i>arizonensis</i> is not attempted here
although it may be stated that in several characters <i>fusus</i> is intermediate
between <i>arizonensis</i> to the south and <i>nanus</i> to the north.</p>

<p>Some measurements not given above are included in <a href="#table_1">Table 1</a>,
together with the number of specimens and the sex if restricted to
one sex. So that the variability can be evaluated more adequately,
the coefficient of variability and 2 times the standard error of the
mean are included for the measurements in two series. The series
consist of all the adult specimens (with a condylobasilar length of
24.0 mm. or more) of both sexes from the areas specified. Various
barriers are shown in <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a> for comparison with the distributions
of the subspecies and the localities of known occurrence shown in
<a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>. <i>Microtus montanus</i> has not been taken in the Black Hills
area of extreme northeastern Wyoming. Suitable montane habitat
is present and both <i>Microtus pennsylvanicus insperatus</i> and <i>Microtus
longicaudus longicaudus</i> occur there. The arid basin of the Powder
River presumably is a barrier that has prevented <i>M. montanus</i> from
reaching this area.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
